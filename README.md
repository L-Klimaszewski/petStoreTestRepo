## General Information
  The Petstore application is a popular RESTful API used for learning and testing purposes. In this project, 
 I have written a suite of tests to ensure that the endpoints of the Petstore API are functioning as expected.
  In addition to API testing, I have also included tests for the frontend of the Otomoto.pl website.  These tests ensure 
 that the user interface is working correctly and that users can perform basic actions on the website.
